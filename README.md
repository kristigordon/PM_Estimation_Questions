# PM_Estimation_Questions

A starter guide to the estimation questions that a PM is faced with in an interview. 

Estimation questions show the interviewer how effective you will be planning a software engineering project or initiative.

But don't worry. There is a formula that gives you a solid foundation with any estimation question you'll be faced with in an interview. 
Using Cracking the PM Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell and Jackie Bavaro, I'll take you step by step through it all.

# Step 1: Clarify the Question
Ask all the questions you can think of about the uses, communitity, consumer, and resources. 

# Step 2: Catalogue what you know or wish you knew
Parse out the things you know that might affect this outcome. 

# Step 3: Equation
Dont just see this step and run from this article. Every question should have some sort of equation. This shows that you are a grounded 
person that thinks in terms of data and real world problems/solutions. It doesn't have to be complex, even a simple equation can display 
a general aptitude for problem solving. 

# Step 4: Challenge Yourself - Edge Cases and Alternate Sources
Interviewers don't want someone who just doesn't look for, or even worse, actively ignores obstacles instead of facing them head on. Take a minute
to show off your thought process by discussing the limitations on the equation and revising what you wrote. 

Show care with the problem. This isn't just a random scenario, this is a stand in for the interviewers product they have been working on for a year or ten! 
Reassure them that you don't take anything lightly and give each response and step a lot of thought.
